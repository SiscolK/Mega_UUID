# UUID
A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID) is also used.

# ID
An identifier is a name that identifies (i.e. labels the identity of) a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the "object" or class can be an idea, physical [countable] object (or a class thereof), or [uncountable] physical substance (or class thereof). The abbreviation ID usually refers to identity, identification (the process of identification), or an identifier (ie, an instance of identification). An identifier can be a word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of them.

# MID
Mega id is a new id type made by me, is a id that is used to accounts and other projects.
